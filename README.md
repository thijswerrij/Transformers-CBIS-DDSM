## Acknowledgements
This repository uses code from two other repositories:
* Large part of this project was based on code by Md Tahmid Hossain (tahmid0007), see his repository [VisualTransformers](https://github.com/tahmid0007/VisualTransformers).
* During cropping we use [crop_mammogram.py](https://github.com/nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier/blob/master/src/cropping/crop_mammogram.py) from the [breast_cancer_classifier](https://github.com/nyukat/breast_cancer_classifier) repository.
